    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The <em>Mona Lisa</em> is one of the most valuable paintings in the world.
        It is oil painting on a popular wood panel by <em><b>Leonardo da Vinci</b></em>,
        probably the world’s most famous painting.It was painted sometime between 1503 and 1519, when Leonardo was
        living in Florence, and it now hangs in the Louvre Museum, Paris, where it remained an object of pilgrimage in
        the 21st century. The sitter’s mysterious smile and her unproven identity have
        made the painting a source of ongoing investigation and fascination.
    </p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p><em><b>Leonardo da Vinci</b></em> began painting the <em>Mona Lisa</em> about 1503, and it was in his studio when
        he died in 1519. He
        likely worked on it intermittently over several years, adding multiple layers of thin oil glazes at different
        times. Small cracks in the paint, called craquelure, appear throughout the whole piece, but they are finer on
        the hands, where the thinner glazes correspond to Leonardo’s late period. In 1911 the painting was stolen,
        causing an immediate media sensation. People flocked to the Louvre to view the empty space where the painting
        had once hung, the museum’s director of paintings resigned, and the poet Guillaume Apollinaire and artist Pablo
        Picasso were even arrested as suspects. Two years later an art dealer in Florence alerted local authorities that
        a man had tried to sell him the painting. Police found the portrait stashed in the false bottom of a trunk
        belonging to Vincenzo Peruggia, an Italian immigrant who had briefly worked at the Louvre fitting glass on a
        selection of paintings, including the <em>Mona Lisa</em>. He and possibly two other workers had hidden in a
        closet
        overnight, taken the portrait from the wall the morning of August 21, 1911, and run off without suspicion.
        Peruggia was arrested, tried, and imprisoned, while the <em>Mona Lisa</em> took a tour of Italy before making
        its
        triumphant return to <em> France</em>.

    <h2>Where is monalisa in modern world? </h2>
    <p>It was acquired by King Francis I of <em> France</em> and is now the property of the French Republic. It has been
        on
        permanent display at the Louvre in Paris since 1797.</p><br><br>
